# Development Multitool

This [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) frontend allows for easy access to various tools.

## Tools

[FLK to Wavefront OBJ converter](https://github.com/TeamPopplio/flk-to-obj-converter)

[CVS Checkout](http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/cvs)

[Symbol Viewer](http://www.mingw.org/)

[Image Viewer](https://imagemagick.org/)

## Multitool Usage

To use this tool, either run it using [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) or download binaries in [releases](https://github.com/TeamPopplio/development-multitool/releases/).

## 'FLK Converter' Usage

To use the 'FLK Converter' tool, you must first checkout the FLK file using CVS (see below).

Be aware that not all FLK file formats are supported, try using the 'Verts only' mode if any issues arise.

## 'CVS Checkout' Usage

To use the 'CVS Checkout' tool, you must first download a copy of the ``cvs`` executable.

Download and extract the zip file for your platform [here](http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/cvs/binary/stable/) (``x86-woe/`` for Windows) and place the executable somewhere.

You may add it to your PATH variable but it's not necessary.

## 'Symbol Viewer' Usage

To use the 'Symbol Viewer' tool, you must first be running on an environment with the 'objdump' command natively supported.

On windows, you can download [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/wiki/getting_started) and install the 'mingw32-binutils-bin' package.

## 'Image Viewer' Usage

To use the 'Image Viewer' tool, you must first install [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php).

If you're on Windows, the 'convert' program is not available. You must change its executable to your 'magick.exe' path.
